## Supported Versions

As this repository doesn't have a downloadable release, there will be no "supported versions". I will probably never go back and update old code for this as it is a yearly updating repository with solutions to Advent of Code Puzzles. Run them at your own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here's how you can [report a known vulnerability](https://github.com/melvinquick/advent-of-code/security/advisories/new).

I will do my best to update any vulnerabilities that get reported, but as stated above, I may or may not get to it.
